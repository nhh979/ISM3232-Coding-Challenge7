# Coding Challenge 7

Through this project, we create a simple customer feedback form that allows user to submit their feedback, which is displayed on the same webpage after submission. We learn to create basic HTML structure to define the **form** elements and display area for feedback. We then implement the form with **input fields**, including *text input*, *dropdown* and *textarea*, and a **submit button** to collect user feedback. Finally, we use JavaSciprt to handle form submission, validate input fields and update the webpage with the submitted feedback.
